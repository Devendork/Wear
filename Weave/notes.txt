Density: 30 epi
PPI: 18. 

Draft is a 2pic system, meaning one inch is 48 draft rows. The first pic (from bottom) is the system for traces and bobbles, the second from the bottom is the base fabric. 

Base Fabric: 
Black Silk
Every 96th row, the weaver throws single shuttle of akagi silk
Supplemental Akagi silk warp every 60 pics from the start

Traces + Bobbles
Ground and Power will be reprresented by black/grey cord respectively. All Analog selectoins will be white 30 AWG silicone. 

Bobbles are hand integrated in regions marked by all warps being raised. Manually pass under in order to bind into fabric. 

Each bobble system has a connection to POWER -> thermo -> A0 -> sensor -> GND. The A0 pin is always opposte the ground and power. 

Leave all traces long at ends for simplified connecting.
